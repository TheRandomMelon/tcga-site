	<p>
		Once the Nomination Committee picks the categories and nominees, a Google Form is opened to the public to decide the final winners in each category. Most category votes are optional, making sure people only pick if they are properly informed. Voting in as many categories as you can is encouraged to allow more voices to be heard at the award ceremony.
